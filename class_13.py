#  break & continue statement in python...

# Break Statements---------
# Break Statement Is Used To 

# i =1
# while i<=10:
#     print('6 * ',(i), '=', 6*i)
#     if i>=5:
#         break  # Use Of Break Statement In Python
#     i=i+1

#Continue Statements--------
# Continue Statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and the control flow of the program goes to the next iteration.

# for i in range(5): # Range Function Runs (n-1) times
#     if i == 3:
#         continue  # Skip The Current Iteration...
#     print(i)


# Question:
#WAP to print the numbers from 1-10 which are odd numbers

# for i in range(10): # Range Function Runs (n-1) times
#     if i%2 == 0:
#         continue  # Skip The Current Iteration...
#     print(i)


# Qustion:
# WAP to find the sum of all +ve numbers less than hundred that are divisible by 7,and break the loop once the sum exceed 1000...

# total = 0
# for i in range(100):  # also can use range(1,100)
#     if i%7==0:
#         total = total + i
#     if total >= 100:
#             break
# print(total)  


# for i in range(5):
#     if i == 3:
#         pass # Pass Also Called As No Operation Statements
#     print(i)

# While Loops

# i=1
# while i<=10:
#     print(i)
#     i+=1
